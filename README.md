# OpenLRR
An open source re-implementation of [LEGO Rock Raiders (PC)](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego_Rock_Raiders_%28video_game%29). This is created by slowly implementing and replacing game functionality, while relying on the original executable and game assets for everything else.

OpenLRR is not associated with The LEGO Group or Data Design Interactive. When using the name "OpenLRR" within this project, the **L** must never be expanded (i.e. do not write "Open _LEGO_ Rock Raiders").
